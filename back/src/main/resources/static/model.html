    Guam is the largest island of Micronesia and, like many islands, once provided a home to a fantastic assemblage of
    native birds, reptiles, and mammals. The vast majority of these species are now extinct, and the remaining ones are
    threatened with extinction. Although many factors contributed to the loss of species, the principal cause is the
    invasive brown tree snake.

    During the Second World War, the United States Navy established a large naval base on Guam. With the end of the war
    in 1945, the base proved useful for recovering <span id="vocabulary1">abandoned</span> war materials from the
    region, in particular, vehicles, aircraft, and other supplies from New Guinea where these items may have sat unused
    for some time. The brown tree snake is native to New Guinea and other regions of Australasia. It is typically
    nocturnal and, during the day, rests within crevices and holes that provide good cover. It is commonly found in
    wheel wells on airplanes, under the hoods of cars, and in boxes of cargo, and most biologists think the brown tree
    snake was a hitchhiker within surplus Navy equipment brought to Guam from New Guinea in the postwar years of
    1945-1950.

    The brown tree snake was first noticed along Guam’s southern shore near Apra Harbor. It then spread, somewhat
    slowly, until it occupied the entire island by 1970. Guam has no native snakes and no native predators that could
    have controlled tree snake numbers. <span id="square1" class="square"></span> Instead, the native vertebrates were
    all small species vulnerable to predation by the generalist tree snakes. <span id="square2"
                                                                                   class="inserted-sentence"><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">As early as the late 1960s, native birds were disappearing from Guam's forests.</span></span>
    The decline of most native forest animals was immediate and dramatic. <span id="square3" class="square"></span>
    Guam’s Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources discontinued surveys of native birds and bats in the 1970s, as
    there were so few individuals of these species to count. <span id="square4" class="square"></span> The three native
    birds and mammals that persisted the longest were the Mariana fruit bat, Guam rail, and island swiftlet. The fruit
    bat and rail were relatively long-lived species that likely persisted simply because some individuals escaped
    predation and lived out the remainder of their lives; however, neither species had any reproductive success in the
    presence of the tree snake. The island swiftlet persists to this day but is confined to one cave on Guam. The
    swiftlet builds nests on the walls of caves using its own saliva and mud to adhere the nest to the cave wall.
    Despite this unusual habit, swiftlets are still vulnerable to tree snake predation, as tree snakes can easily
    capture prey in total darkness and climb most surfaces. The one cave where swiftlets persist is unique in that the
    cave walls are not textured enough for snakes to support themselves. This does not <span
        id="vocabulary3">inhibit</span> the swiftlet’s ability to build nests, but it does prohibit tree snakes from
    reaching those nests.

    There have been many other losses of native forest animals on Guam. Consequently, the food web of Guam’s forests
    (the dominant native habitat) has shifted dramatically. The most striking change is the reorganization of the web to
    one in which most components are nonnative. Beyond the brown tree snake, the Polynesian rat, Philippine turtledove,
    and the house mouse, among other nonnative species, have been successively established. Three native lizards survive
    in Guam’s forests. All the lizards are small and active during daylight. One would assume that, with the destruction
    of the native food web, the brown tree snake would suffer from a lack of food resources, but the available pool of
    invasive prey and native lizards maintains tree snake densities. Consequently, native species went extinct with no
    corresponding negative effect on the tree snake. The tree snake even seems to be adapting to the diurnal habits of
    the remaining native lizards, since biologists have documented a shift in the tree snake’s previously nocturnal
    activity pattern to one that increasingly includes activity during daylight hours.

    The reduction in the complexity of the Guam food web has had consequences beyond the loss of native animals. The
    loss of mammalian and avian insectivores presumably increased insect abundances at some cost to agricultural crops
    and to crop production. And newly introduced nonnative species may find it easy to invade Guam given the many “open
    niches” left by the loss of native species.
