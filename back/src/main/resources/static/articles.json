    "heading": "Guam and the Brown Tree Snake",
    "context": "<div style=\"white-space: normal;\"><br /></div>\n<p>\n  Guam is the largest island of Micronesia and, like many islands, once provided a home to a fantastic assemblage of native birds, reptiles, and mammals. The vast majority of these species are now extinct, and the remaining ones are threatened with extinction. Although many factors contributed to the loss of species, the principal cause is the invasive brown tree snake.\n</p>\n<div style=\"white-space: normal;\"><br /></div>\n<p>\n  During the Second World War, the United States Navy established a large naval base on Guam. With the end of the war in 1945, the base proved useful for recovering abandoned war materials from the region, in particular, vehicles, aircraft, and other supplies from New Guinea where these items may have sat unused for some time. The brown tree snake is native to New Guinea and other regions of Australasia. It is typically nocturnal, and, during the day, rests within crevices and holes that provide good cover. It is commonly found in wheel wells on airplanes, under the hoods of cars, and in boxes of cargo, and most biologists think the brown tree snake was a hitchhiker within surplus Navy equipment brought to Guam from New Guinea in the postwar years of 1945-1950.\n</p>\n<div style=\"white-space: normal;\"><br /></div>\n<p>\n  The brown tree snake was first noticed along Guam's southern shore near Apra Harbor. It then spread, somewhat slowly, until it occupied the entire island by 1970. Guam has no native snakes and no native predators that could have controlled tree snake numbers. Instead, the native vertebrates were all small species vulnerable to predation by the generalist tree snakes. The decline of most native forest animals was immediate and dramatic. Guam's Division of Aquatic and Wildlife Resources discontinued surveys of native birds and bats in the 1970s, as there were so few individuals of these species to count. The three native birds and mammals that persisted the longest were the Mariana fruit bat, Guam rail, and island swiftlet. The fruit bat and rail were relatively long-lived species that likely persisted simply because some individuals escaped predation and lived out the remainder of their lives; however, neither species had any reproductive success in the presence of the tree snake. The island swiftlet persists to this day but is confined to one cave on Guam. The swiftlet builds nests on the walls of caves using its own saliva and mud to adhere the nest to the cave wall. Despite this unusual habit, swiftlets are still vulnerable to tree snake predation, as tree snakes can easily capture prey in total darkness and climb most surfaces. The one cave where swiftlets persist is unique in that the cave walls are not textured enough for snakes to support themselves. This does not inhibit the swiftlet's ability to build nests, but it does prohibit tree snakes from reaching those nests.\n</p>\n<div style=\"white-space: normal;\"><br /></div>\n<p>\n  There have been many other losses of native forest animals on Guam. Consequently, the food web of Guam's forests (the dominant native habitat) has shifted dramatically. The most striking change is the reorganization of the web to one in which most components are nonnative. Beyond the brown tree snake, the Polynesian rat, Philippine turtledove, and the house mouse, among other nonnative species, have been successively established. Three native lizards survive in Guam's forests. All the lizards are small and active during daylight. One would assume that, with the destruction of the native food web, the brown tree snake would suffer from a lack of food resources, but the available pool of invasive prey and native lizards maintains tree snake densities. Consequently, native species went extinct with no corresponding negative effect on the tree snake. The tree snake even seems to be adapting to the diurnal habits of the remaining native lizards, since biologists have documented a shift in the tree snake's previously nocturnal activity pattern to one that increasingly includes activity during daylight hours.\n</p>\n<div style=\"white-space: normal;\"><br /></div>\n<p>\n  The reduction in the complexity of the Guam food web has had consequences beyond the loss of native animals. The loss of mammalian and avian insectivores presumably increased insect abundances at some cost to agricultural crops and to crop production. And newly introduced nonnative species may find it easy to invade Guam given the many \"open niches\" left by the loss of native species.\n</p>",

    "heading": "Was There Water on Ancient Mars?",
    "context": "<div style=\"white-space: normal;\"><br /></div>\n<p>\n  Despite Mars's bleak, cold climate today, there is abundant geologic evidence that liquid water once flowed on the Martian surface (and even recent evidence that some water still periodically flows today). The evidence of past flows includes river channels, now dry, that were once carved by powerful floods; valley networks of branching streams and tributaries indicating precipitation falling over wide areas; river deltas and layered sediments suggesting flow into standing bodies of liquid water; and salt and other minerals that dissolved in liquid water and were left behind when water evaporated. When that ancient wet period existed and when it ended is difficult to say.\n</p>\n<div style=\"white-space: normal;\"><br /></div>\n<p>\n  The best method for dating a surface uses radioactivity, the process by which certain elements decay over time. One collects rocks from the surface and measures their radioactive elements to see how much of the decay products have accumulated in the rock since it formed. Transferring this age to the age of the surface can be tricky unless one knows where the rock came from. And one needs to collect the samples and bring them to a well-equipped laboratory.\n</p>\n<div style=\"white-space: normal;\"><br /></div>\n<p>\n  The other way to date a planetary surface, which is used when rock samples are unavailable, is by counting craters. The longer a surface has been exposed to meteorite bombardment, the more craters it will have. This gives the relative age and allows one to determine which surfaces are older and which surfaces are younger. To get the actual age, one needs a standard. This was established for the Moon when lunar samples were returned to Earth as part of the United States Apollo program. The crater counts of the areas of the Moon from which the samples came were carefully noted. The samples were dated in terrestrial laboratories using radioactive decay, and the relation between absolute age in years and crater density—numbers per unit area—was determined. This relation is valid for the Moon, and it is possible that it is valid for Mars as well. Then counting craters on a Martian surface should yield its actual age. It is possible, however, that the number of impacting objects is different for Mars. The problem has been carefully studied, and adjustments have been made, but the general conclusion is that a wet period occurred early in Mars's 4.5-billion-year history.\n</p>\n<div style=\"white-space: normal;\"><br /></div>\n<p>\n  This causes a problem for Mars climate science because the Sun was supposed to be fainter, perhaps by 20 or 30 percent, during the Mars wet period. Yet a watery Mars arguably would have required relatively warm temperatures. The power output of the Sun—its luminosity over time—is based on models of its interior and evolution. The models are well tested and agree with the luminosities of stars like the Sun whose ages are known. The same problem exists for Earth, which appears to have been warmer billions of years ago than it is today. Geologists have called this the \"faint young Sun paradox.\" The solution to the paradox probably lies in climate science and not in the theory of stellar evolution, but the issue has not been entirely settled.\n</p>\n<div style=\"white-space: normal;\"><br /></div>\n<p>\n  If Mars was wet billions of years ago, was it also warm? There could have been catastrophic floods released from underground aquifers (layers of rocks that can contain water) where the top surface of the water froze like the top of a Hawaiian lava flow. The solid crust forms an insulating layer, trapping the heat of the liquid and allowing it to flow for great distances without freezing. Lava tubes on Hawaii are empty channels where lava once flowed in this way. Thus, the climate of Mars could have been wet but not warm, with the water flowing entirely under the ice. Ice sheets and glaciers on Earth today have extensive plumbing systems that allow water to flow and then drain away. Liquid water at the base of glaciers acts as a temporary lubricant and allows them to surge and slide downhill. Flood channels, river deltas, and standing bodies of liquid water all could have existed on Mars under thick layers of ice. The wet-but-not-warm hypothesis has the most trouble with areas that imply sources like precipitation over a wide area rather than the bursting of an underground aquifer. Further study of Mars's geology will clarify these issues.\n</p>",
